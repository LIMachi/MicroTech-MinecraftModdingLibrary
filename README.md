# MicroTech-MinecraftModdingLibrary

Collection of facilities for the MicroTech mods: Dimensional Bags, MacroAutomation (temporary name), etc...

This library contains all my code to manipulate inventories, sync world stored data between server and client, keeping nbt data in broken tile entities, nbt debugging (extended tooltip + alt to show nbt of item), utilities for config files (annotation style configuration), filters, and more.

The library is mostly uncommented and, for now, is not intended to be used by mods not developed by me.

You are free to use this library and all my mods using it in a public/private modpack. Notification of the creation of a public modpack or media (video, image, wiki, toturial) using those mods is appreciated and would allow me to put links/images in this description.
